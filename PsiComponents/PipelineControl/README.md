# Pipeline Control
This is a collection of PSI components that are used to provide an interface to control flow of data in the pipeline.
So far you can Actively turn on or off the connection between two components using a DataFaucet, and you can aggregate
PSI AudioBuffers into a single AudioBuffer then dump the aggregate down the pipeline when Dump() is called using the
AggregateDump component.
